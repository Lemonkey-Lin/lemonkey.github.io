Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a third year PhD student in the [https://lsa.umich.edu/stats Department of Statistics] at the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan], gratefully advised by [https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/gongjunxu/home Gongjun Xu] and [https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/fogartyc Colin Fogarty].

I received my B.S from [https://www.sysu.edu.cn/ Sun Yat-sen University] in mathematics and applied math. I also spent my wonderful sophomore and junior years at [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley] studying statistics, where I was luckily advised by [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/ Will Fithian] doing weighted multiple hypothesis testing under dependency.

== Research Interests
I am generally interested in both of *methodology* and *theory*. Though I am still developing my taste, I currently find these fields interesting.
- Methodology: 
	-- Latent Variable Models
	-- Multiple Hypothesis Testing
	-- Causal Inference
	-- Psychometrics Modeling

- Theory: 
	-- Identifiability and Extremal Problems 
	-- High Dimensional Statistics
