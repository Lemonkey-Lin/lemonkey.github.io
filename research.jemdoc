Power analysis in multiple hypothesis is hard, and sometimes it's very specific to the testing you choose. Moreover, the analysis for sophisticated statistics like LASSO is even more difficult. Hoever, this paper leverages AMP theory (a powerful tool, I learned it from [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/Teaching/STAT260_Spring2021/schedule.html STAT 260]) to give an oracle trade off of FDR and TPP under some specific setting (asymptotic, pi_0 known), and compares the FDR and TPP of knockoff procedure, a predure widely used in practice for LASSO to prove the optimality of knockoff.
