<h2>Research Statement</h2>
<p>Taking these <a href="https://mengqi-lin.github.io/courses.html">PhD courses</a> is almost like undertaking research in these areas, since the contents of these courses are generally based on the professors&rsquo; research directions and are usually quite cutting-edge. </p>
<p>Understanding these concepts necessitates both solid math and critical thinking. While I have some knowledge of these topics <a href="https://mengqi-lin.github.io/blogs.html">(see my blogs)</a> , except for selective inference, I haven't begun substantial research in these areas.</p>
<p>So in this post, I would like to share my learning and understanding roadmap for selective inference only.</p>
<p>The every first paper I read in multiple hypothesis testing area is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10438">Conditional calibration for false discovery rate control under dependence</a>
It took me nearly half a month to fully understand it. 
During the reading process, I reached out to Lihua Lei and asked for help. After understanding the paper, I was able to point out some imperfections in the paper, give out several possible working directions of the paper (though not ideal..)</p>
